# Swiftly

Swiftly was a custom web app I built at a previous company. The premise is we had to tag text content with keywords, as well as review the tags added by others. Instead of painstakingly doing this in Excel spreadsheets, Swiftly enabled my team to do the same work at 3x speed and save hundreds of hours in the process.

To reuse this project for myself, I've had to redact portions of the code including all previous commits. My plan now is to continue improving the app to practice coding and product development. If you have design suggestions for me, e.g. a new concept to apply to the app, please don't hesitate to open a ticket!
